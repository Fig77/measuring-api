## Documentation

### Authentication

Authentication is performed using JSON Web Tokens. JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry-standard [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) method for representing claims securely between two parties. When the user successfully logs in using their credentials, a JSON Web Token will be returned, which should be kept by clients in
local storage (no cookies):

```
"token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE1MzYyMjU5NDUsImV4cCI6MTUzNjMxMjM0NSwic3ViIjoiMzdjMDY2ZjgtNDhjMS00NDZjLTk4OGQtYzQ0ZDQ4MDJiNzZmIiwicm9sZXMiOlsiYWRtaW4iXX0.UwqjX27pGJHJoGjCMkLhBnwoszb9d590upnkRFM0LaA"}
```

Whenever the user wants to access a protected route or resource, the user agent should send the JWT in the Authorization header using the Bearer schema:

`Authorization: Bearer <token>`

### Roles Claim
  Important note
```
Not all actions for ADMIN is currently created, for now, an admin can create by default the items to measure, has control over uses and measurements. Since there is no particular seed at this point, you need to manually add an admin. To do this, you must: Create a new user, with username:unique:string, password, email:unique:string. Create a new Role, with name:unique:string, admin:bool, and unite them with the UserRole through the table.
```

#### Admin role

- At the end version it will: create and delete items, change roles of users, delete users from the server, as well as updating already in place items.


#### User role

- Create an account
- View every item to measure
- Add measurements
- See previous measurements as well as updating the 

## Technology Used

- Rails API
- Postgres
- bcrypt
- JWT
